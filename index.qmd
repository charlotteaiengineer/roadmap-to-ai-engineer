This is a living, outcome-driven curriculum for becoming an AI Engineer. The dates are simply the day I began that course. Some parts can take a long time to complete, often I went back and forth into different topics to get a better understanding.

Check out what I've been learning this week, or change the ordering to 'Oldest' to start from scratch too.
