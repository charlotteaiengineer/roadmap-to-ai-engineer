The core idea is an LLM that can **tweak its own parameters**.

An LLM that has **core drivers, motivations, and goals**.

> The goal of AGI developers is to create an AI model that has the cognitive abilities of a human, including the human brain's ability to reason, learn, and solve a wide range of tasks.
