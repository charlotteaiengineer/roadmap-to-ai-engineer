I've got a theory on Dopamine and it goes like this: people nowadays are addicted to social media, tiktok, and video games (yep I'm coming for those too). I can say this because there was a time in my life I too spent from moment of waking to moment of sleeping on mobile games and social media. My life at the time was pretty shit (thanks to my own doing for most part), so the online world was far better. 

Turns out it is not only me... it is everyone I see. Most people are depressed nowadays, they don't like socialising (try getting mates to hang out with you on short notice...its not happening). Why? they've used up all their dopamine for the day - flat out depleted.

People used to have boring lives. Boring as shit. Your best moments were diving into books and imagining fantasy lands, and hanging out and meeting human beings, and perhaps going on walks and exploring the world around you. 

People 'back in the day' ENJOYED SCHOOL. Their lives were not constant streams of perfected, animated, hollywood esque random information tailored specific to them. People had to put in more effort to learn things and listen.

I have on my wall a whiteboard of my principals. One of them is "I DO NOT USE TIKTOK". Hwoever I literally downloaded it this mroning and watched for about an hour as "as reward" before deleting it for about the 100th time.

I don't blame myself thought or get angry at myself - this is one of the most exciting things ever created by man. 

We are looking at generational ADDICTION. Addiction to the online.

A portal opened in Ipswich my town center. I got this funny realisation that I was wanting to stand and see other people in different lands...hwoever those standing right next to me I couldn't give a damn about. 

A load of strangers were more intrigued - and far more likely - to interact with people where there was a literal barrier in between them.

Nobody waved at eachother down the street before the portal opened, and still they don't. Hwoever they're more than happy to wave at people they'll never atually bump into in real life. 

We are far more interested in meaningless online interactions than legitimate ones.

#### We are about to see a splitting of society

> We are about to see a splitting of society, the splitting is going to be the people who live their life with completely unfiltered internet access from the second they were born, and the people that were raised by parents that kept them in moderation of screens and technology... we are already seeing the enormouse negative effects of kids who are being raised on ipads. - @betterwithhb

You don't see that many children playing outside anymore.
