Coherence (2013) was a slow burn however it ended with some truly thought provoking ideas, and I'm visited by this feeling of derealisation. 

Life feels like a simulation, or a dream. There is no way of proving whenever I close my eyes and wake up in the morning that my life wasn't just preloaded memories of a past that may or may not have happened. 

Living day by day is beneficial, it makes sense to the majority of the globe. A diary keeps us aware of our current point in time, where and when we are existing. 

However; I mean perhaps these feelings arise from an ape species only supposed to live to around 100 years, each decade feeling like a lifetime. 

However... those around me seem not to change all that much. Again perhaps there's a bias there that I'm not privvy to their new theories and ideas and novel questions - though...I'm yet to hear them. 

Not long ago I was so different, so very different. Different enough to have deep discussions and a full on fight with myself about views I had or actions I did.  

I do feel special in this way, snowflaky in the main character syndrome way I suppose - though how else am I supposed to view this ride? The world does revolve around me because I'm the one percieving the world. When you or I say "the world" that world in which we are in reference to is our own 'worlds'.

I have this theory of the mind; about the way it works. It's not sceientfic by any means, it is just how things feel.
