### I want to retrain to make AI systems

Why a change in career? I've been finding fullstack engineering un-impactful and un-fulfilling. Rendering out data on a page; designing that page to pixel perfection, and getting millions of clicks on buttons I have created doesn't feel awesome to me.

I'm so glad I went down this route and tried it out... however when I tell people what they should do with their lives, I tell them to study AI and get involved. 

It is the next technological revolution and I want to be part of it. I like how it's the closest thing to understand the human brain and trying to emulate it. I like how we become gods in a way of our own simulation. - It's becoming clearer that we are within a simulation, so I want to be a part of the people able to bend the matrix and understand it.

AI isn't only interesting for making lots of money. It could do so much for us. [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/) comes to mind. That's directly some of the most incredible impactful outcomes I've seen in my life.

In another sense I want to get to see AGI. To understand the human mind, truly. I find human intelligence fascinating.
