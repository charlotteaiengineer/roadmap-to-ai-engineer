Hey there — I’m Charlotte, a Frontend‑focused Product Developer who loves building fast, elegant, and accessible web experiences. I dive deep, move quickly, and use strong workflows to ship pixel‑perfect UI.

I started by asking “can I build this?” and dove head‑first into full‑stack projects. Today I lean frontend, collaborate closely with design, and sweat the details that make products feel alive.

**Focus areas**
- Pixel‑perfect UI and component systems
- Rapid, feedback‑driven iteration
- Performance, accessibility, and DX
